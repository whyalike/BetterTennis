# [BetterTennis](https://safe-retreat-89306.herokuapp.com/)
Social network for tennis players

This application was created following the step-by-step [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/) by Brad Traversy. BetterTennis is an adapted version of the application taught in this course.

Though I had experience with MERN stack before, I thought taking this course would allow me to enhance my skills and knowledge with these popular technologies. The course was informative and highly practical. Setting up authentication and understanding the relationship between React and Redux were some of the harder topics, but it helped me as I made notes. The most satisfying part of this course was being able to wrap your head around these difficult concepts. 

My notes can be found [here](./react_notes.pdf).
